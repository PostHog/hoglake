/**
 * Drains hog_file_removal: the physical-deletion half of expiry/GC,
 * decoupled from metadata deletion (README.md §8).
 *
 * The non-negotiable invariant: a queue entry is a suggestion, never an
 * authorization. At drain time every path is re-checked against
 * hog_data_file AND hog_delete_file (any row, live or historical, in
 * the entry's catalog); a still-referenced path is counted as an
 * invariant violation (`still_referenced` — alert-worthy), skipped,
 * and its queue row LEFT UNDRAINED with attempts/last_attempt_at
 * bumped: the reference may legitimately go away later (v1 accepts
 * that a permanently-referenced entry is re-checked every run —
 * bounded by batch order, never a deletion).
 *
 * Draining SOFT-deletes (the forensics lesson: "we reconstructed
 * split-brain forensics from S3 delete markers"): a settled entry is
 * marked drained_at + drained_outcome ('deleted' for a physical
 * removal, 'absent' for verified-already-gone) instead of losing its
 * row, so what cleanup touched, when, and after how many attempts
 * stays queryable. The drain query reads only undrained rows (partial
 * index), and every sweep also PURGES drained rows older than
 * [ledgerRetentionSeconds] — the ledger must not itself become the
 * unbounded-accumulation problem it documents.
 *
 * Deletes run in sub-batches of [subBatchSize] (25 in production;
 * constructor-tunable for tests). Each sub-batch is ONE transaction
 * that (1) takes the per-catalog advisory commit lock (Locks.kt — the
 * SAME key as every commit/DDL tail), (2) re-checks references, (3)
 * physically deletes, (4) settles the ledger rows — so a later
 * sub-batch failure never rolls back completed ones. A missing object
 * (404) is success ("already gone") and drains its row as 'absent'; a
 * per-object delete failure bumps attempts and leaves the row queued
 * for the next run without wedging the rest of the batch.
 *
 * WHY the lock (the check-then-delete TOCTOU): without it, a commit
 * transaction could pass ITS removal-queue check, insert a hog_data_file
 * row for a queued path, and be mid-flight (uncommitted, invisible to
 * READ COMMITTED) exactly when this drain computes referencedPaths —
 * the drain would see the path unreferenced, delete the object, and the
 * commit would then land a live row pointing at a deleted object.
 * Holding the catalog commit lock across the check+delete pair
 * serializes the two: either the commit finished first (its rows are
 * visible to the check, path skipped as still-referenced... and its own
 * queue-collision check would have 409'd anyway while the entry was
 * undrained), or the drain finishes first and the commit's collision
 * check runs after the entry settles. No interleaving remains.
 *
 * LOCK-HOLD BOUND: one sub-batch = one reference-check query + at most
 * [subBatchSize] × (HEAD + DELETE) S3 calls + two ledger UPDATEs. At
 * the production sub-batch of 25 and ~50 ms per S3 round trip that is
 * ≈ 2.5 s worst case per sub-batch — well under the 30 s commit
 * admission timeout; commits queue behind a sub-batch, never a full
 * batch. Keep [subBatchSize] small; the lock hold scales linearly in it.
